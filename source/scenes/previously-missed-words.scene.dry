= Previously Missed Words

In previous years this would have been harder, but these days you can get lists down from the internet. The cards and their definitions paper your walls, like leaves on a tree. 

- @fust: FUSTANELLA
- @noisette: NOISETTE
- @canicular: CANICULAR
- @tiralee: TIRALEE
- @whole-list: Do the whole list right now.


@whole-list
choose-if: motivation > 0
on-arrival: spelling +=1; motivation -= 1

It takes a double study session to get through the entire stack, but you manage to break the words into categories and the categories into subcategories. SHRIEVAL and WICCAN, HOMINY and SUCCOTASH, ECRU and FÃŠTE.


@tiralee

TIRALEE, a succession of musical notes. It's onomatopoetic.


@canicular
view-if: spelling > 4

CANICULAR. To do with dogs. From the Latin *canis*. 

Sometimes it gets into your dreams at night. CANICULAR cake. The Canicular Bakery. Dog-shaped cakes. 

You dream of lopping off an ear full of pastry cream.


@noisette

NOISETTE. A hazelnut. Or a cut of meat similar to the size of hazelnuts.


@fust
view-if: spelling < 5

FUSTANELLA. A kilt-like garment of the Balkans. And it's pronounced pretty much the way it's spelled, so how hard will that be?
