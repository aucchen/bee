Bee by Emily Short
==================

Sooner or later, you're going to lose. Only one person wins the National
Spelling Bee each year, so an elementary understanding of the odds means it
almost certainly won't be you.

The only question is when you fail, and why.


## About Bee and Dendry

[Bee](http://varytale.com/books/book/short-bee/) was written by Emily Short
using the [Varytale](http://varytale.com) format for interactive books.
Dendry has a similar model for how interactive fiction works, so it is a
natural choice for a port of Bee.

The code for the book is shared here as an example of writing a complete and
complex story using Dendry. The text of the story itself is copyright,
however, and cannot be duplicated or shared without the author's permission.
See the [License](LICENSE) file for more details.
